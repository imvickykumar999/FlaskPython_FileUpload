# FlaskUpload_withPWD
A simple flask upload program for multiple files requiring credentials



## For code used in the Medium article, look at :

- app.py
- templates/upload_simple.html
- config_simple.py
- secure_db.py
- new_user.py


Begin by creating a new database:
```
python secure_db.py --wipe
```
and adding a user
```
python new_user.py bob ./ my_password
```



Now we have a database, we can run the app with
```
python app.py
```

and the uploaded files should appear in a directory named `uploads_folder`
